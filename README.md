# similarity_measures
Analysis of DNA sequences to detect single base mutations, and use of similarity measures to see whether the different sequencings hold multiple mutations. 
These measures are also useful to compare text.

Here the library pyranges is used, but also a manual calculation is showed and compared.
Set operations are required to obtain differences between sequence groups.

Different similarity measures are shown. It is important to use different measures and to compare them as a validation step.
